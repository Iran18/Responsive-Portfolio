            <h1>Bullshark</h1>
            <article>
                <p>The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark (informally "zambi") in
                    Africa, and Lake Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm,
                    shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, and
                    presence in warm, shallow brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers.</p>
                <h2>Continued</h2>
                <p class="p_2">Bull sharks can thrive in both salt and fresh water and can travel far up rivers. They
                    have been
                    known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois,[3] about 700 miles (1100 km)
                    from the ocean. However, few freshwater human-shark interactions have been recorded. Larger-sized
                    bull sharks are probably responsible for the majority of near-shore shark attacks, including many
                    bites attributed to other species.[4]

                    Unlike the river sharks of the genus Glyphis, bull sharks are not true freshwater sharks, despite
                    their ability to survive in freshwater habitats.</p>
